                    Follow the instructions of the exercise and implement your
                    solution.

                <p>
                    Then, you can see the result of your solution in the console
                    and if the solution is correct the test should pass.

                /** * Exercise 21: * * 1. Create a class named `Person` that
                takes in as parameters * * firstName * lastName * * 2. The class
                should use the constructor method to receive * the parameters
                for when a new instance of the class * is created. * * 3. Once
                you have created the Person class, you should * create a new
                person using the `new Person(...)` * expression. Then, you
                should store the newly created * person in the `ana` variable. *
                * 4. The class should also have a method named `sayName` * that
                returns the concatenation of the firstName and lastName * with
                an empty space in between. * * @example * * "Alex Marks" * * 5.
                Create a class named `Employee` that takes in as parameters * *
                firstName * lastName * jobTitle * * 6. The `Employee` class
                should extend the `Person` class and use the * `super()` method
                call to pass the `firstName` and `lastName` * to the `Person`
                parent class. * * 7. The `Employee` class should declare inside
                the constructor * the `jobTitle` property as itâ€™s own besides
                the ones passed * to the super() call. * * 8. The `Employee`
                class should also declare a method named `getJobTitle` * that
                returns the `jobTitle` of the `Employee` */
